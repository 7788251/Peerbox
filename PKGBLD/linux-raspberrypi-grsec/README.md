The grsecurity kernel provides many security-related improvements.
It hardens both the kernel and userspace against common memory corruption vulnerabilities,
along with providing many miscellaneous features and a role-based access control system.
It is the only way to secure the kernel itself against exploitation, which is the most important improvement
for a system already making good use of user isolation, containers/chroots and sandboxes.
