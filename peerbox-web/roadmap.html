- Write detailed description of project, explaining goals and methods.

- Finish filesystem-peerbox package

add automated installation of /var/lib/ppcoind, setting up ppcoind user

- Package pre-configured firewall

- Use more optimal filesystem for SD cards, encrypt it

j2fs is in plan, but it still lacks some features so I'll wait for upstream or think of something else.

- Package the blockchain

I plan to "bootstrap" the blockchain, with this feature deployment of new nodes will be a lot faster.
User can only do: pacman -S peercoin-blkchain and in moments it will be synced.

- Configure and package linux-grsecurity (http://grsecurity.net/)
This is a major security improvement!

- Add limited user to Peerbox, disable root account.

- Write grsec rules for ppcoind and other important parts of system

With this release I'll remove warning to not use Peerbox for minting. By now, Peerbox will be 99% secure.

- Shave more weight of the system

- After this, I expect projects based on Peerbox, like user friendly interface and detached with stats, monitoring etc.
