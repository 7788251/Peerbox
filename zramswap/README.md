## Zramswap

This package is pulled from AUR; https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/zramswap/
It creates zram based swap device in RAM. By pluging out the device swap partition is deleted.
This is due concern that swap file/partition may contain sensitive data
which is left on the disk after the system is shut down.
